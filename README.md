This is a repository for TT Sprint 3 Statistical Data Analysis that analyzes cell phone plan data. The project determines which prepaid plan brings in more revenue for the company.
- This project used independent t-tests to compare whether there were significant differences in revenues between plans, and for a specified location.
- Data was prepared, aggregated, and exploratory analysis conducted prior to the final t-tests.
- The project was built on the Jupyter platform using Python to code, including the Matplotlib library for data visualization and SciPy library for analysis.
- The project was developed by the data science student, reviewed by a project reviewer and final edits made by the students based on the review
